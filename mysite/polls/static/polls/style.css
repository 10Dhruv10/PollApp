/* we make polls inside as well in static/polls/style.css because if we had 2 or more apps django will search 
for static in all apps and if it finds static that static is used for all which shouldn't be happening */
/* this static 'url' way of writing is only with django and css/js files and to link 2 css etc files use relative paths like url("images/cool-background.png") */
/* e.g. in our index.html we did "static 'polls/style.css'" that tells it to use speficially the polls/style.css inside static folder somewhere */
